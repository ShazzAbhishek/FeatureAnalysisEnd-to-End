# FeatureEngineering
# Not all dataset require machine learning implementation to come with the analysis.
# This Notebook explains important feature engineering techniques:
# 1) select k best features for feature selection
# 2) VarianceThreshold methods(dropping low and consatnmt variance)
# 3) Mutual Information gain
# 4) Chisquare Test For Feature Selection
